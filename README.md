Python libraries for C++

#
Hi,my name is Vuk and I'm pripary student in Serbia.
This is my mini project for trainintg and prepparing for much bigger project.
As you se,I code in C++ cuz all Python libraries are written in C++.
So if you wanna clone my code,you must have Visual Studio 2019 or older.
Yeah,sorry for that.I'm just a begginer so this will imrove later.
And I wanna say this isn't a library you want to use while you're coding
some big stuff,it's just a mini project I started for training myself.
