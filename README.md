Python libraries for C++

#
-Hi,my name is Vuk and I'm primary student in Serbia.
-This is my mini project for trainintg and prepparing for much bigger project.
-As you se,I code in C++ cuz all Python libraries are written in C++.
-So if you wanna clone my code,you must have Visual Studio 2019 or older.
-Yeah,sorry for that.I'm just a begginer so this will imrove later.
-And I wanna say this isn't a library you want to use while you're coding
-some big stuff,it's just a mini project I started for training myself.
